# The Start of a Journey

In order to keep myself more honest with my goals and progress (measuring to be effective), I'm going to publicize my journal of activities in the format of a github blog. The idea behind this is to hold myself accountable for what I say I'm going to do in a format that is public. The best way I know how to motivate myself is to share my ideas and progress publicly.

For too long, I've held my side projects private for a variety of reasons. I didn't want anyone to steal my "great" idea. Nor did I want anyone to see how shitty my project was at a certain point. Once one milestone was reached, I already had three more milestones that had to be reached before the project was in a good enough state to release. Once those milstones were reached, I found a cleverer way to solve a problem. Simplifying is genius right?  

# Goals

> Success is the progressive realization of a worthy goal or ideal.  - Earl Nightingale

I believe in the holy trinity of success: health, wealth, and relationships. More importantly, I believe in the power of setting goals in order to achieve any measurable success.
